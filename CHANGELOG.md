- `deploy` command now requires valid image pull credentials (`--credentials`). Most repositories and use-cases require authorized image pulls, so this change aims to guide correct usage.
  - Deploying without credentials can be achieved with the `--no-credentials` / `-nc` or `--force` flags.
  - It is always recommend to provide a an image pull secret as part of your deployment.

## [0.1.8] - 2025-07-09

### Changed

- `deploy` command now shows a warning when image pull credentials are not provided.

### Added

- Add py.typed marker for static type checking support.

## [0.1.7] - 2025-06-12

### Added

  - Users who prefer to manually copy and paste the authentication URL
